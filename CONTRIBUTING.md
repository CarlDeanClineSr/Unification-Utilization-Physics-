# Contributing to Unification Observatory

Welcome to the Unification Observatory project! We appreciate your interest in contributing to this interdisciplinary effort bridging gravitational wave physics and JWST spectroscopy.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build mathematical and observational bridges between:
- **Gravity**: Strong-field tests with high-SNR gravitational-wave events
- **Quantum-state spectroscopy**: JWST rovibrational/isotopic lines

## How to Contribute

### Scientific Contributions

#### Gravitational Wave Analysis
- **Theory/Math**: Contribute to `gravity_math_snippets.md` with new algorithms or refinements
- **Data Analysis**: Help with O4a anchor event analysis plans in `gravity_tests_plan.md`
- **Cross-validation**: Assist with IMR consistency, ringdown spectroscopy, and ppE/PN tests

#### JWST Spectroscopy
- **Line Lists**: Help validate and cross-check ExoMol/HITEMP/HITRAN databases
- **Retrieval Methods**: Contribute to `jwst_retrieval_snippets.md` algorithms
- **Target Planning**: Assist with observational strategy for Programs 8714, IRAS16547, B335

#### Cross-Disciplinary Connections
- **Mathematical Framework**: Enhance `math_scaffold.md` with unified approaches
- **Information Geometry**: Develop shared mathematical tools for both domains
- **Model Selection**: Contribute Bayesian methods applicable to both GW and spectroscopic data

### Documentation Contributions

#### Real-time Monitoring
- **Status Updates**: Help maintain `live_status_8714.md` and `live_status_jwst_queue.md`
- **Workflow Improvements**: Enhance GitHub Actions for automated status tracking
- **Quality Control**: Contribute to `caveats_and_solutions.md` with practical insights

#### Research Documentation
- **Research Logs**: Contribute entries to `research_log/` with dated updates
- **Target Documentation**: Help expand target-specific plans and analyses
- **Cross-references**: Maintain links between related documents and analyses

## Contribution Process

### 1. Getting Started
- Read the `README.md` and browse existing documentation
- Check `caveats_and_solutions.md` for known issues and best practices
- Review the current research log entries for context

### 2. Making Changes
- **Small updates**: Edit files directly via GitHub interface
- **Larger contributions**: Fork the repository and create pull requests
- **Real-time data**: Use the GitHub Actions workflow for status updates

### 3. Quality Standards

#### Documentation
- Use clear, concise language
- Include mathematical notation where appropriate
- Cross-reference related files and sections
- Maintain consistent formatting with existing files

#### Mathematical Content
- Include units and invariant checks
- Show derivations for non-trivial results
- Provide implementation guidance
- Include uncertainty/error analysis considerations

#### Observational Content
- Reference specific JWST programs and observation IDs
- Include wavelength ranges and instrument configurations
- Note data availability and proprietary periods
- Provide quality assessment criteria

### 4. Collaboration Guidelines

#### Communication
- Use GitHub Issues for scientific discussions and questions
- Tag relevant contributors for domain-specific questions
- Be respectful of different scientific backgrounds and expertise levels

#### Attribution
- Credit data sources (LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, JWST/STScI)
- Acknowledge collaborators and prior work
- Follow appropriate citation practices for academic content

## Data Handling

### JWST Data
- Respect proprietary periods (typically 12 months)
- Use appropriate MAST archive references
- Follow STScI data sharing guidelines
- Include observation metadata in documentation

### Gravitational Wave Data
- Reference GWOSC catalog entries where applicable
- Include GW event naming conventions
- Respect LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA data release policies
- Cite appropriate detection papers

### Computational Resources
- Avoid committing large data files to the repository
- Use external storage for processed data products
- Include data provenance and processing version information

## Getting Help

- **Scientific Questions**: Open a GitHub Issue with appropriate labels
- **Technical Issues**: Check `caveats_and_solutions.md` first, then open an issue
- **General Discussion**: Use GitHub Discussions for broader topics

## Code of Conduct

This project follows standard academic and open-source collaboration principles:
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions
- Welcome questions from scientists of all experience levels
- Maintain scientific rigor while encouraging creative connections
- Support reproducible and transparent research practices
