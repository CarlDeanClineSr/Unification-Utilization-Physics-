Scope
- Gravity: select O4a anchors and define analysis runs.
- JWST: lock Program 8714 monitoring; frame IRAS16547 and B335 plans.

Gravity actions
- Pull posteriors for GW230814_230901 and GW231226_101520; run IMR splits; ringdown fits; ppE scan with −1PN emphasis.
- Start hierarchical combiner for δf_220, δτ_220 and −1PN across high-SNR subset.

JWST actions
- Program 8714: subscribe to visit updates; record modes/exposure configs upon completion; note 12-month EAP.
- IRAS16547: assemble lab profile library for 3.05, 3.53, 4.27, 4.67 μm; MIRI 6–8 μm templates.
- B335: prep IFU cube pipeline (WCS, mosaicking, channel maps); shock model grids for CO v=1–0.

Notes
- Keep math guardrails: invariants, posterior–prior shifts, residual structure.
- Track line-list sensitivity for isotopes; flag residual patterns unique to isotopologues.
