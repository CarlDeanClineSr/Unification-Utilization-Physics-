Program 8714 — First-pass retrieval targets (bands and isotopologues)

NIRSpec (2.9–5.3 μm; likely G395H/F290LP)
- CO v=1–0 (4.6–5.0 μm): 12CO, 13CO
- CO2 ν3 (~4.26 μm): 12CO2, 13CO2
- CH4 ν3 (~3.3 μm): 12CH4, 13CH4
- H2O (3.0–3.3, 4.5–5.0 μm); HDO (D/H leverage)

MIRI MRS (5–12+ μm)
- CH4 (~7.7 μm), H2O rotational, NH3 (~6.1, ~10.5 μm), PH3 (if feasible)

Diagnostics and QC
- Cross-line-list checks (ExoMol/HITEMP/HITRAN)
- Overlap consistency (e.g., CH4 at 3.3 vs ~7.7 μm)
- Residual scoring at isotopologue-only lines
