- Title: Add LUFT lattice-collapse (Infinity Galaxy), evidence, Drive ingest, and JWST status workflow
- URL: https://github.com/CarlDeanClineSr/Unification-Utilization-Physics-/pull/2

Overview
We explored a LUFT-based mechanism for central supermassive black hole (SMBH) nucleation during galaxy mergers, inspired by JWST’s “Infinity Galaxy.” The idea: two pre-existing SMBHs sweeping past each other destabilize a discrete quantum lattice, triggering a rapid, non-classical collapse (“foam rupture”) that seeds a central SMBH without traditional gas accretion.

Key decisions
- EM portal retained: Keep χ φ F² in the LUFT EFT baseline to enable constraints from CERN/LHC (diphoton/exotics).  
- Parameter strategy: Start with wide priors for m_eq and α; narrow after first fits to the Infinity Galaxy geometry and SED.
- Modeling note: LUFT collapse provides a microphysical alternative inside the broader “direct collapse” phenomenology; predictive discriminants focus on encounter geometry and early non-accreting central object.

Core math used
- Drift (ansatz): v_drift = (ħ / m_eq) |∇φ|  
- Collapse proxy: Q ≈ (ħ/m_eq) · α · (G M) / (r_p v_rel²)  
- Collapse if Q ≥ Q_c (~ O(1))  
- Critical pericenter: r_crit ≈ (ħ α G M) / (m_eq Q_c v_rel²)

2) Code
   - src/luft/collapse.py

   - scripts/scan_infinity_params.py  
     - Prints r_crit vs. sample α, m_eq for Infinity-like encounters.

3) Evidence notes
   - docs/evidence/EVD-2024-07-29-jades-z14.md (JADES z ≈ 14 confirmations)  
   - docs/evidence/EVD-2025-06-infinity-galaxy-dcbh.md (Infinity Galaxy candidate direct-collapse SMBH context and what to extract)

4) Workflows and utilities
   - .github/workflows/fetch-drive.yml + scripts/ingest_drive.sh  
     - Fetch external files from Google Drive into the repo (manual dispatch).
   - .github/workflows/status-update.yml  
     - Append timestamped rows to jwst_live_status.md for observational tracking.

Initial priors (to be updated after first fit)
- α ∈ [1e−6, 1e−1] (log-uniform)  
- m_eq (kg) ∈ [1e−10, 1e+2] (log-uniform)  
- Q_c ~ 1 by definition of the trigger threshold

How to run (after merge)
- Quick parameter scan:
  - python scripts/scan_infinity_params.py  
- Programmatic checks:
  - from luft.collapse import compute_Q, critical_pericenter, nucleates

Workflows (manual dispatch in GitHub Actions)
- Fetch a file from Google Drive:  
  - Inputs: file_id, out_path  
  - Saves to your chosen path (e.g., data/external/source.pdf)
- Append JWST status entry:  
  - Inputs: date_utc, obsid, instrument, mode, state, t_exp?, dithers?, notes?

Observational discriminants to watch (Infinity Galaxy)
- Early central object: X-ray faint, AGN-line poor, low Eddington ratio.  
- MIR (MIRI 7.7 μm) delayed; ALMA dust continuum initially weak.  
- Shell/ring morphology aligned with dual nuclei; central dispersion spike without immediate ordered inflow.  
- Timescale for ignition: ~ 10^6–10^7 yr (settling/cooling dominated).

Planned next steps
- Literature sweep (past 24–48 hours) for:
  - Infinity Galaxy updates (masses, separation, SED constraints, X-ray/MIR follow-up).  
  - JWST high-z black hole candidates relating to direct collapse.  
  - LHC/CERN bounds on scalar–photon portals constraining χ.  
- Add a notebook to visualize r_crit across priors and encounter geometries.  
- Fit geometry from the Infinity Galaxy preprint to narrow (α, m_eq) and update theory note.

Notes from Carl
- We’ll “ride the waves of science,” iterate with new ideas and data, and tighten the model. No hard directives yet—wide exploration first, then focus as evidence lands.
