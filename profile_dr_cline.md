Profile — Dr. Carl D. Cline (“Dr. Cline”)

Trajectory (abridged)
- Master electrician; master machinist; field dynamics scientist; master commercial driver/mechanic.
- 45 years nationwide fieldwork across 48 states and thousands of sites — system-level intuition honed by lived complexity.
- Caregiving and systems stewardship: resilience and responsibility embedded in operations.

How this informs the science/engineering
- Systems thinking: model interactions, not just parts.
- Diagnostics mindset: measure, compare, iterate — use residuals as signal.
- Safety/reliability: expect instrument quirks; mitigate with checklists, redundancies, overlaps.
- Out-of-the-box builds: prototype fast, keep the math honest, then harden.

Operating principles
- Math holds the build: action, symmetries, information geometry, inference.
- Data decide: high-SNR anchors guide; low-SNR broaden.
- Self-checks: invariants, units, priors vs posteriors, residual maps.
