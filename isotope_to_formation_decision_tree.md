Isotope/element ratios → formation and accretion narrative (decision tree)

Start: retrieve T–P, gravity, clouds/hazes, Z, C/O using multi-band data.

1) D/H (HDO/HD proxies)
- Elevated above stellar → cold formation beyond snow lines; ice-rich solid delivery
- Near-stellar → gas-dominated accretion and/or mixing/high-T processing

2) C/O (with metallicity)
- C/O > 0.8 and super-stellar Z → late solid enrichment beyond H2O line; CO/CO2 ice influence
- C/O ~ stellar with high Z → mixed accretion; solids + gas near/beyond water line
- C/O < stellar → gas capture interior to water line; oxygen-rich gas

3) 13C/12C
- Near-stellar with high Z → efficient gas capture; weak fractionation imprint
- Deviations → low-T fractionation zones; CO vs CO2 ice regimes

4) 15N/14N (hard)
- Elevated 15N → low-T N2/NH3 fractionation; nitrogen via planetesimals

Consistency checks
- Compare with internal structure constraints (g, R if known)
- If inconsistent, revisit clouds vs composition degeneracy and line-list systematics

Outcomes
- Ice-rich pebble-dominated beyond CO/CO2 lines with migration
- Mixed solid+gas near/beyond H2O line
- Gas-dominated inside H2O line with limited solids
