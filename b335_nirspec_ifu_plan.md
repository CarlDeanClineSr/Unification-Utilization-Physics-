B335 — NIRSpec IFU shock mapping (Proposal 4537, Cycle 3, GTO)

Setup
- Target: B335-protostar (Extended=YES), RA 19:37:00.8795, Dec +07:34:09.29
- Mosaic: 1×5 tiles; ~10% row overlap, 60% column overlap; PA-V3 ≈ 100°
- Spectral: G395H / F290LP (R ≈ 2700); 4-point dither; MSA leakcal exposures
- Rationale: heavy extinction at shorter λ; focus on 2.9–5.3 μm

Science
- Resolve shock fronts near the protostar; compare with scattered continuum (reflection nebula).
- Lines: CO v=1–0 (4.6–5.0 μm); H I Brα (4.05 μm) if present.
- Products: IFU cubes → velocity-channel maps; rotational temperature diagrams; shock-type (C/J) discrimination; disk vs shock kinematics.

Ops notes
- Execute full MSA leakcal plan (crowded background)
- Watch NIRSpec 1/f; validate via overlap mosaic tiles and dithers
- Register shock knots vs ancillary imaging for decadal continuity
