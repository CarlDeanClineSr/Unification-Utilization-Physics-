JWST targets — spectroscopy as quantum-state probe

Program 8714 (Cycle 4) — Cold Jupiter isotopes
- Goal: elemental + isotopic ratios (D/H, 13C/12C, 15N/14N, 18O/16O) to reconstruct formation radius and accretion history.
- Status: Flight Ready; EAP 12 months after each visit completion.
- Watch: Space Telescope Live visit states; log modes/exposures.

Key bands
- NIRSpec (2.9–5.3 μm; G395H/F290LP typical):
  - CO v=1–0 (4.6–5.0 μm): 12CO, 13CO → 13C/12C
  - CO2 ν3 (~4.26 μm): 12/13CO2
  - CH4 ν3 (~3.3 μm): 12/13CH4
  - H2O (3.0–3.3, 4.5–5.0 μm), HDO (D/H leverage)
- MIRI MRS (5–12+ μm):
  - CH4 (~7.7 μm), H2O rotational, NH3 (~6.1, ~10.5 μm), PH3 (if feasible)

IRAS 16547 — background sightline (Gas/Dust/ISM)
- Ices: H2O 3.05 μm, CO2 4.27 μm, CO 4.67 μm, CH3OH ~3.53 μm, 6–8 μm complex
- Gas: CO v=1–0, warm H2, selected organics

B335 with NIRSpec IFU — Proposal 4537 (Cycle 3, GTO)
- Mosaic 1×5; G395H/F290LP; R~2700; 4-point dither
- Science: CO fundamentals in shocks near the protostar; kinematics vs disk-scattered continuum

Caveats/fixes
- Degeneracies: multi-band + multi-instrument
- Line lists: ExoMol/HITEMP/HITRAN cross-checks
- Instrument: MIRI fringing, NIRSpec 1/f; use latest pipelines and overlaps
