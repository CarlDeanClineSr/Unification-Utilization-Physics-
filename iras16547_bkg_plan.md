IRAS16547-bkg — Gas/Ice bridge plan (ISM, high-mass protostar environment)

Objective
- Derive ice and gas column densities/compositions; constrain temperature history and processing (UV, shocks).

Observing concept
- NIRSpec (3–5 μm): Ices (H2O 3.05, CO2 4.27, CO 4.67, CH3OH ~3.53 μm); gas CO v=1–0; continuum baselines.
- MIRI MRS (5–12+ μm): 6–8 μm complex, NH3 (~10.5 μm), additional H2O/CH4 lines.

Analysis flow
- Continuum normalization; ice profile fits with lab templates (mixtures, temperatures).
- Gas rovibrational fits → T, N, v-components.
- Cross-link ice/gas columns to infer desorption pathways and processing.

Risks/mitigations
- Blending (6–8 μm): require MRS resolution; template libraries.
- Deep absorption calibration: validate with standards; robust baseline fitting.
- Background source variability: monitor continuum; bracket with adjacent exposures.
