Caveats and how to beat them

- Degeneracies: clouds vs composition vs gravity; mitigate with joint NIRSpec+MIRI coverage and multi-band checks.
- Line-list systematics: use ExoMol/HITEMP/HITRAN cross-checks; isotopic ratios are sensitive to positions/intensities.
- Instrument quirks: MIRI fringing and NIRSpec 1/f; use current best pipelines and fringe/1f detrending; cross-validate overlaps.
