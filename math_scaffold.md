Math scaffold that holds the project

Principles
- Action and symmetries: dynamics from stationary action S = ∫ L d^4x; symmetry → conservation (Noether).
- Geometry and causality: metric g_μν, geodesics, curvature; for data manifolds use information geometry (Fisher metric).
- Fields and spectra: wave equations in curved backgrounds (GW modes); rovibrational Hamiltonians for molecules; line strengths/positions anchor inferences.
- Inference as physics: Bayesian hierarchical models encode causal structure (population hyperparameters, event-level, instrument/noise).

Concrete tools
- GR tests: IMR consistency; ringdown QNMs; ppE/PN phase terms; modified dispersion/massive graviton; area theorem.
- Spectroscopy: isotopologues via effective Hamiltonians; retrievals across bands; information geometry to diagnose degeneracies.

Cross-link gravity ↔ spectroscopy
- Common structure: modes in a background (QNMs vs rovib lines).
- Shared math: spectral inversion, model selection, parameterized deviations constrained by high-SNR data.

Guardrails
- Unit checks, invariants; prior–data conflict; residual structure (line-by-line/QNM residuals).
